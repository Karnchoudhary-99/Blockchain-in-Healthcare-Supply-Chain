Track the delivery and authenticity of medical supplies in the healthcare system
# Blockchain in Healthcare Supply Chain

## Project Description
This project aims to enhance the healthcare supply chain by leveraging blockchain technology to track the delivery and authenticity of medical supplies. By using smart contracts, the system ensures transparency, security, and trust in the distribution process.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to build a decentralized and tamper-proof healthcare supply chain that ensures the safe and secure delivery of authentic medical supplies to healthcare providers, reducing the risk of counterfeit drugs and medical equipment.

## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time tracking of medical supplies.
- Implementing QR code scanning for instant verification of product authenticity.
- Developing a user-friendly mobile application for supply chain tracking.
- Expanding the system to track other critical healthcare resources like oxygen cylinders and vaccines.
- Enhancing security by implementing multi-signature approval for supply authentication.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Tracking:** Ensures data integrity and transparency throughout the supply chain.
- **Supply Creation:** Records new medical supplies with default statuses (not delivered, not verified).
- **Status Update System:** Tracks and updates delivery and authenticity status.
- **Enhanced Security:** Utilizes blockchain's immutability to prevent data manipulation.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded to support multiple healthcare organizations and suppliers.
